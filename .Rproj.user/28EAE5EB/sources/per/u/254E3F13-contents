## Experimenting with python and R markdown
I like Rmarkdown quite a bit for making interpretable code projects with nice formatting, and I was  surprised to learn that it apparently works with python too. So now, because I'm a masochist, I'm going to try out getting python and R to play with eachother and see if this might be a feasible way to develop skills in both. 

```{python torch}


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
